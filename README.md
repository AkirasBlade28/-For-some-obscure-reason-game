in one line theres a if statment:
if(bullScore==4 | (bullScore==3 && cowScore==1)).
This can seem confusing.
By the rules of the game if 3 bulls and 1 cow is scored, wich this program does throw, is ilogical, or absurd statment!
Becouse, if we have one cow but 3 bulls, where does that cow come from if it's place (number) is not already a bull?
By observing, compiler cant decide what to throw if one number is a bull, but other, the same number, 
is  a cow, at different position in number.
That if statment clears this issue.
